# Brainify
> **Note:** This project is still in planning and development. These are our ambitions, **we are students and also have school to work on!**

**Brainify** is an under development project, our idea is to make a **clean and reliable** revision tool that students can use to further their understanding of a subject.

I came up with this idea when doing revision for my end of year exams, and I though why not make **a revision platform made for students by students**!

# Our Plan

Our plan is to make an **easy to use revision tool** that students can use to help further their education. Our main focus is **science**, with out eyes set on other subjects such as **maths** and **english**. Our plans for our resources are to ask **real teachers** for content to put in our recorces.

## Not Just For Students!

Teachers will also benifit from Brainify, with a dashboard to see students progress, and methods to set classwork or homework.
